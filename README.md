# 📚 Project Documentation Hub

This repository contains the generated documentation for multiple projects built with **Flutter**, **Django (Python backend)**, and **React**.  
Each project’s documentation is stored in its own folder with static HTML files, and a common `index.html` file in the root serves as the **welcome page**.
